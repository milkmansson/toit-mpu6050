## About Toit
One would assume you are here because you know what Toit is.  If you dont:
> Toit is a high-level, memory-safe language, with container/VM technology built
> specifically for microcontrollers (not a desktop language port). It gives fast
> iteration (live reloads over Wi-Fi in seconds), robust serviceability, and
> performance thatâ€™s far closer to C than typical scripting options on the
> ESP32. [[link](https://toitlang.org/)]
